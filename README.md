website-start-script
====================

Clone this and run the bash script if the CS department ever does anything weird to the hacksu server that breaks the website.

So simple:
```
git clone https://github.com/hacksu/website-start-script
cd website-start-script
chmod u+x start.sh
sudo ./start.sh
```
